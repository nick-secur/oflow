OFF Analysis Notes

The algororithm divides the visual field into zones based on step size. The step size determines the stride over the pixel array.

- The larger the step size the fewer the zones.

- It seems the algorithm does better on mailsecur video with larger step size (c.f., 32 vs. 4). Maybe because of limited color information?


Fluid/Powder motion detection heuristics

Heuristic 1
  a. compute the vector magnitude for each zone
  b. only render/add a zone if it exceeds a threshold

UI strategies

  a. show a warning light when motion exceeds threshold...

  b. Overlays
    (1) try to relate color to direction of movement detected
    (2) only render when motion threshold is exceeded...

  c. tracking
    (1) try to show a tracking indicator (needle) with the overall direction of movement being shown...
    (2) ...


This buys us...

1. AT THE VERY LEAST you have basic motion detection. This in itself is useful to us (counting scans, detect system in use, etc... )

2. The problem is RELATIVE motion detection (which I still think we can get...)


NEXT STEPS

1. Try to apply filters (denoise, color, etc.)

2. PHASE TWO: more senstive motion algorithms (look for lucas kanade with pyramids) ...

3. IMPORTANT Get a baseline video showing pencil moving across screen in one or two directions...

4. Also get denoised video ... ?


COMPELLING VIDEOS

1. Empty container (slight movement) vs. fluid container (more movement)

2. Powders and crystals...

3. chips/cards ...

3. ...

NOTES ON RAW PIXEL PROCESSING IN REAL TIME VIDEO ...

You won't get any raw access to video data without blitting a video frame on <canvas> first. However, I believe this operation should be HW accelerated as it happens all in GPU memory. Downloading pixels down from GPU manipulating them in Javascript and then uploading back to the display memory might be the slowest step for high resolution.
